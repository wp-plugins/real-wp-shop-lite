Light, powerful, easy to use and theme WordPress e-commerce plugin that utilizes ajax for better experience.

== Description ==

Super easy to use, ajax-powered ecommerce shopping cart plugin for WordPress.

Real WP Shop (RWPS) Lite follows standard WordPress methodology for theming, so you can make themes for it like you would make any other theme for wordpress.

It supports paypal for online payment processing, and allows for custom payment options that don't include online payment processing ( e.g. cash on delivery, western union, moneygram etc.).

RWPS Lite does not force anything.

I DO NOT offer support for the lite version. If you have a question, you can ask here on the plugin's forum, but I will probably not answer ( unless I think it will be useful for many people).

If you find **BUGS**, please post them on the plugin's forum here, and I will GET RIGHT ON IT.
